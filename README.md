# Timecard Summary with Dash
One of the major tasks of a project manager is cost management. As a project manager in a civil engineering consultancy firm, I was responsible in managing the cost of consultancy projects. The major cost of a consultancy is human resources, and team members will book their timecard according to their work load into the system each week. The system will generate timecard records in the format of CSV/excels accordingly.

As projects involve multiple departments/displines, it is useful to visualize the expenditure by departments during a certain period of time. As such, I have built this simple dash application to facilitate the project management work. 

The data used, "Timecard_example.xlsx", has a similar format to the system generated timecard record in my company. Sensitive data has been removed and substitued.
