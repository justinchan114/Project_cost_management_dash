# Timecard-dash
One of the major tasks of a project manager is cost management. In my experience working in a civil engineering consultancy firm, I was responsible in managing the cost of consultancy projects. The major cost of a consultancy is human resources, and engineers will book their timecard according to their work load into the system each week.
As the projects involve multiple departments/displines, it is useful to visualize the expenditure by departments during a certain period of time.
As such, I have built this simple dash application to facilitate the project management work. 


The data used, "Timecard_example.xlsx", has a similar format to the system generated timecard record in my company. Sensitive data has been removed, and substitued by adjusted burdened_cost and names.
