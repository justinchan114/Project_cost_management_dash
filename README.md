# Project Cost Management with Dash
Dashboard to visualize the expenditure of individuals/teams for project managers in a company.

__Background__</br>
As a project manager in a civil engineering consultancy firm, this is the tool I used for cost management, summarizing the cost of consultancy projects. The major cost of a consultancy is human resources, team members will book their timecard according to their work load into the system each week. The system will generate timecard records in the format of CSV/excels accordingly. As projects involve multiple departments/displines, it is useful to visualize the expenditure by departments during a certain period of time. As such, I have built this simple dash application to facilitate the project management work. 

__Data Format__</br>
The data used, "Timecard_example.xlsx", has a similar format to the system generated timecard record in my old company. Sensitive data has been removed and substitued.
